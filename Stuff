# NHANES 2021-2023 Inferential Analytics

## Project Overview
This project performs inferential statistical analyses on NHANES 2021-2023 data to explore relationships between health metrics and demographic variables using Python.

**Dataset**: NHANES 2021-2023 from https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/

## Research Questions & Analyses

### Question 1: Marital Status and Education Level
**Question**: Is there an association between marital status and education level?

**Test**: Chi-Square Test of Independence

**Why**: Testing association between two categorical variables

**Result**: Significant association found (p < 0.05)

---

### Question 2: Sedentary Behavior by Marital Status
**Question**: Is there a difference in sedentary behavior time between married and not married individuals?

**Test**: Independent t-test

**Why**: Comparing means of a continuous variable across two groups

**Result**: Married individuals have significantly less sedentary time (p < 0.05)

---

### Question 3: Age, Marital Status, and Blood Pressure
**Question**: How do age and marital status affect systolic blood pressure?

**Tests**: Pearson Correlation and Independent t-test

**Why**: Testing correlation with age (continuous) and comparing groups by marital status

**Results**: 
- Age positively correlated with BP (p < 0.05)
- No difference in BP by marital status (p > 0.05)

---

### Question 4: Weight and Sedentary Behavior
**Question**: Is there a correlation between weight and sedentary behavior?

**Test**: Pearson Correlation

**Why**: Examining relationship between two continuous variables

**Result**: Weak positive correlation (r = 0.156, p < 0.05)

---

### Question 5: Education and Diastolic Blood Pressure
**Question**: Does education level affect diastolic blood pressure?

**Test**: Independent t-test

**Why**: Comparing means of a continuous variable across two education groups

**Result**: Bachelor's degree holders have lower diastolic BP (p < 0.05)
